*My passion is building solutions out of thin air, and my mission is to help Earth by creating useful products*

I enjoy identifying programming patterns and pain points, then optimizing daily tasks to make my work and the work of others more effective.
I collaborate with artists and programmers from all over the world to bring useful products to the market.
